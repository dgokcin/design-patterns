/*
Use the Facade pattern when
- You want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
only clients needing more customizability will need to look beyond the fa√ßade.
- There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems
- You want to layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem
level. If subsystems are dependent, make them communicate with each other solely through their facades.
